    The returned dependency resolves to the media type the client wants from
    the given server-offered list. `server_offers` is the menu this endpoint
    can produce, in order of *server* preference — the first entry is the
    fallback when the client expresses no usable preference.

    Negotiation rules:

    1. If the client's `Accept` header explicitly lists one or more
       `server_offers`, the most specific listed entry wins. Specificity
       follows RFC 6838's structured-suffix rule: `application/fhir+json`
       refines `application/json`, so when both are listed the structured-
       suffix form is picked.
    2. Otherwise (no header, `* / *` only, or no overlap), the first entry of
       `server_offers` is returned.

    Case-insensitive. Media-type parameters and q-values are ignored.
